    <h1>Benefits of Electric Vehicles (EVs)</h1>
    <p>Electric vehicles offer numerous advantages over traditional gasoline-powered cars. Here are some key benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Eco-friendly:</strong> EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, helping reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases.</li>
        <li><strong>Lower Operating Costs:</strong> Electricity is generally cheaper than gasoline, leading to cost savings in the long run.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Maintenance:</strong> EVs have fewer moving parts compared to combustion engines, resulting in lower maintenance requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Quieter Ride:</strong> EVs operate more quietly than traditional vehicles, reducing noise pollution.</li>
        <li><strong>Government Incentives:</strong> Many governments offer tax credits, rebates, and other incentives to promote the adoption of EVs.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Electric vehicles are typically more energy-efficient than internal combustion engine vehicles.</li>
    </ul>
